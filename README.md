PDF Accessibility Assessment Framework (RAPDF 1) version 1.0

the PDF Accessibility Assessment Framework has been developed to serve as a basis for evaluation and implementation for all public sector bodies concerned by the [Luxembourg law of 28 May 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo).

It is available at this address:
[https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/rapdf1/](https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/rapdf1/)

RAPDF 1 is made up of the following documents:

* [Introduction](./en/introduction.md)
* [Criteria and tests](./en/referentiel-technique.md)
* [Glossary](./en/glossaire.md)
* [Methodology](./en/methodologie.md)
* [Environment](./en/environnement.md)
* [References](./en/references.md)

## Markdown format

All files are made available in Markdown format, in a version that can be interpreted by the [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) library.
We have used an extension of the Markdown format [markdown-it-attrs](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-attrs) that allows the specification of HTML attributes, these attributes being particularly useful for language changes.
